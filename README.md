# art-2010-generative-art
As part of a performance art piece, I decided to put my skills to use and make a computer generative art piece.

It works by creating an array of radiuses for calculating circles, and then drawing a line from random points on the edge of the screen to the center of it. At the border of each of these circles, the program will invert the color of the line, repeating this process several times until it reaches the center. This creates a sort of optical illusion where despite these being circles, it looks like a spiral as long as you aren't looking directly at the center of the image.

This was implemented in Processing 4.0.1.
